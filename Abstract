-> DESCRIPTION:-
    Crop Recommendation System for agriculture is based on various input
    parameters. This proposes a hybrid model for recommending crops to south
    Indian states by considering various attributes such as soil type, Rainfall,
    Groundwater level, Temperature, Fertilizers, Pesticides and season.
    The recommender model is built as a hybrid model using the classifier
    machine learning algorithm. Based on the appropriate parameters, the system
    will recommend the crop.
